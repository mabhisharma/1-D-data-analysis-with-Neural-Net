# 1-D-data-analysis-with-Neural-Net
Analysis of how Neural Networks transform the data so that non linear classification boundary can be learned

To get a better sense of what’s going on, let’s consider an dataset that’s 1-dimensional:
Class A - [-1/3, 1/3]
Class B - [-1, -2/3] U [2/3, 1]

The representation of the data can be shown as follows -
